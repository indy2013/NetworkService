This is a networked dice roller for Dungeons and Dragons, allowing the DM to change values of saving throws and players to roll their dice of choice in order to succeed in saving throws.

## Usage
### DM
As the DM, you can Change the Value of saving throws to a random or static value by sending the value with IndyPenders>Dm>1D20 or IndyPenders>Dm>20.

### Players
As a player, you can roll a die to try to succeed a saving throw or to have a duel with a player, simply send a message to IndyPenders>pl>name>1D20>+0+0+0+0+0+0>st for a saving throw or  IndyPenders>pl>name>1D20>+0+0+0+0+0+0>duel for a duel.
